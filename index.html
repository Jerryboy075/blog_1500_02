            <p>This article is all about, digital etended reality affect online safety.
                Author speaks about the pros and cons of extended reality. This article says that
                the extensive use of extended reality games increase the incidents of 
                cyberbullying, harasement and virtual sexual assault. However, this extensive
                reality technology systems does a lot of help for the people those who are 
                disabled and it can be used education purposes also.

            <p>This article tells us that a group of apple laptops could work as a supercomputer.
            These days, scientists and other companies who use supercomputers, they are looking for 
            other ways to minimise their expenses in making and maintaining these supercomputers.
            Supercomputers are very expensive to build and it have be maintained frequently. They are 
            seeing the group of apple laptops as a reliable and less expensive alternative, because it
            can also do huge numbers of parallel calculations.

            <time>18 November 2022 </time>
            <p>This article is about a revolutionary technology to predict cyclones and big storms more accurately. A new system 
                to predict the chances of cyclones by examining the muon particles in the atmosphere. This invention is done by
                a team of reasearchers led by Professor Hiroyuki Tanaki. This helps to visualize the cyclones more accuratly, which 
                can help in giving accurate warnings to people, those who are living in the affected places. By using this system they
                can see the cyclones in a 3D perspective. But it is not a alternative to the conventional predicting methods, what this does is, it 
                adds accuracy.
