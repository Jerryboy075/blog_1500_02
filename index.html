                Author speaks about the pros and cons of extended reality. This article says that
                the extensive use of extended reality games increase the incidents of 
                cyberbullying, harasement and virtual sexual assault. However, this extensive
                reality technology systems does a lot of help for the people those who are 
                disabled and it can be used education purposes also.

            <p>This article tells us that a group of apple laptops could work as a supercomputer.
            These days, scientists and other companies who use supercomputers, they are looking for 
            other ways to minimise their expenses in making and maintaining these supercomputers.
            Supercomputers are very expensive to build and it have be maintained frequently. They are 
            seeing the group of apple laptops as a reliable and less expensive alternative, because it
            can also do huge numbers of parallel calculations.

            <time>18 November 2022 </time>
            <p>This article is about a revolutionary technology to predict cyclones and big storms more accurately. A new system 
                to predict the chances of cyclones by examining the muon particles in the atmosphere. This invention is done by
                a team of reasearchers led by Professor Hiroyuki Tanaki. This helps to visualize the cyclones more accuratly, which 
                can help in giving accurate warnings to people, those who are living in the affected places. By using this system they
                can see the cyclones in a 3D perspective. But it is not a alternative to the conventional predicting methods, what this does is, it 
                adds accuracy.

            <p>UK government is trying to increase the coverage of high speed internet connection all over the country especially in remote locations by
                using Elon Musk's Starlink technology. UK government is planning to do a trial of internet connectivity at three remote
                locations. They are planning to proceed with the connection after the trials. They are trying to figure out how more 3000 low Earth-orbit
                small satelites to be used to provide internet connectivity to hard to reach places like mountains. Many tests has shown that starlink 
                satelites can provide high speed internet upto 200 megabits per second.

            <p>San Fransisco is now allowing the police force to use "Killer robots" which is armed.
                The authority is saying that the police force can use this robots to deploy heavy explosives
                in bad situations. But they reported that they won't use this robots now, although these robots
                can be used in future. The author of this article is noting an example which happened  some years
                ago in Dallas, Texas, some police robots, killed a sniper who had killed two officers and
                injured many people by using C4 explosives.
